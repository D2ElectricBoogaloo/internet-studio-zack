	<h1>Original summary</h1>
	<p>I wanted to put together a streaming service dedicated to horror related films and tv shows. There are some advantages and disadvantages to designing this idea.</p>
	<h2>The White Hat</h2>
	<p>The White hat tells me I have information about my streaming service, facts on what its target audience is, and what information it will provide.</p>
	<h2>The Red Hat</h2>
	<p>.The Red hat implies that I add feelings or emotions for when the users what to get the experience of my new streaming service.</p>
	<h2>The Black Hat</h2>
	<p>The black hat tells me there are some negatives to making this streaming service such as parental guidance, licensing, and copyright.</p>
	<h2>The Yellow Hat</h2>
	<p>The yellow hat puts in a positive note for my streaming service such as getting hard core horror fans to watch movies in the comfort of their home or mobile devices.</p>
	<h2>Green Hat</h2>
	<p>Green hat offers some creativity and alternating changes, such as customization of the user interface, styling the home page and customizing the user profiles.</p>
	<h2>The Blue Hat</h2>
	<p>Lastly the Blue hat the overview prosses of my streaming service. Once I launch Screamstream, I get all the data collected by our subscribers and surveys that will help me make improvements.</p>

	<h1>Additional Summary</h1>
	<p>After receiving feedback from my peers, I feel like I need to focus more on The Red and Black hats. My classmates have made some good points about how I can improve feelings for users when they tune into my streaming service. I also need to double check the licensing and copyright rights to prevent legal troubles. </p>
