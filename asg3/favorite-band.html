	<h1>Linkin Park</h1>
	<p>Linkin Park is my favorite band!</p>
	<h2>Band Bio</h2>
	<p>Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon; after Bennington's death in July 2017, the band endured a seven-year hiatus, during which Bourdon chose to depart from the band. In September 2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.</p>
	<h2>Why they are my favorite band</h2>
	<p>I grew up listining to Linkin Park when I was in elementry school. I would jam out to their hit album "Hybrid Theroy" and set thier hit song "In the end" on repeat during my down times. Linkin Park's lyrics resemble everything I was going through during my early years and I still pay tribute to the late Chester Bennington. I do like the new female vocalist Emily, but Chester will always have a place in my heart. Long live Linkin Park!</p>
