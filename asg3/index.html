	<h3>Better User Experience Through Storytelling Articles</h3>
	<p>Framing your project in story format can benefit your ideas by forcing you to think from the user’s perspective. Storytelling enables you to structure your story ideas from begging, middle, and end, just like a narrative from a feature film or book. This helps clarify the issue you are resolving, who you’re resolving it for, and how your solution fits into your journey. By understanding the user’s emotions, goals, and challenges, you can better align your design decisions and ensure that every element on your story format serves a purpose in the overall experience. Storytelling also helps communicate your vision more effectively to others, making your ideas more cohesive and compelling for users to enjoy.</p>
	<h3>Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Love and Typography</h3>
  <p>Establishing hierarchy is always essential for guiding the reader’s attention and improving readability. According to the article, “Effective hierarchy gets people to look where you want them to look, when you want them to look there.” Without effective hierarchy, you’re going to make the reader feel confused and frustrated. It also depends on how you modify your hierarchy with the size, weight, color, style, and placement. The best examples of hierarchy come from movie poster designs, billboards, and bus stops that display big letters and colorful texts. Speaking of placements, they play a role in positioning key elements at the top or center of a layout which can give viewers more visual priority. Additionally, typography styles like italics or all caps can be used to emphasize specific words or phrases. These techniques work together to develop a visual structure to help navigate readers with browsing new content.</p>
