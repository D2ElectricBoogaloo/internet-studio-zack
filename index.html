	<h2>About Myself</h2>
	<p>I was borm and raised here in dallas texas. I have lived in Austin for about 8 years because I wanted to persue a carerre in game design. I later shifted over that path to learn radio-televison and film. I got my degree in computer science at my community college in Austin. I have decided to go back to school at UTD to learn audio engeinering. I amn eager to learn new technology aspects fromn this semster. My overall goal is to pass this class to fulfill my requirement. I do however want to gain some coding knowledge for job opportunities. Iâ€™m currently working with my dad has his technical producer. I mainly focus on social media and graphic design work for his law firm. I feel like I can get some coding skills out of this class to help my dad or other law firms with website development.</p>
