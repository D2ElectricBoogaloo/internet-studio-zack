	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p>The three key elements I’ve learned from reading all three materials about web design are the critical web design, the evolution of the web, and the birth of web standards.</p>
	<h3>What is Critical Design</h3>
  <p>According to the introduction on chapter 0, I learned that web design is much more than creating graphics and windows, but it focuses on the aspects of developing a good website. Critical web design presents itself as a bridge between media and internet art, and hybrid practices such as critical web making.</p>
  <h3>The Evolution of the Web</h3>
  <p>What I have learned from the evolution of web is the internet is evolving with new software applications and social media platforms. What I really found interesting was Web 1.0 and 2.0 I was familiar with all these apps I grew up with, but 3.0 was really shocking to me as I’ve never seen or used Maker or Ocean. I’m aware that AI is changing the world we live in today, but I’m concerned if it will take over the job aspects of programming or web development.</p>
  <h3>The Birth of Web Standerds</h3>
  <p>From what I read about in the birth of web standards, new tags and layout converted. Newer technologies like CSS have got more widespread adoption by browsers makers, developers and designers. This informed other coding authors to shift over to play teaching roles to show developers and designers why the standards are important, how to implement them, and how to sell them to their organizations.</p>
  <h1>My Purpose</h1>
  <h3>What I want to learn from this class</h3>
  <p>My overall goal is to pass this class to fulfill my requirement. I do however want to gain some coding knowledge for job opportunities. I’m currently working with my dad has his technical producer. I mainly focus on social media and graphic design work for his law firm. I feel like I can get some coding skills out of this class to help my dad or other law firms with website development.</p>
