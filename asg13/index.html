        <h1>Career Research Results</h1>
        <h2>Throughout this semester, I wanted to learn how to make websites. After taking design 1, I have gained the knowledge to layout and structure my webpages and use them to create spectacular and interactive visuals. I’m currently trying to figure out what I want to do with my life. I’m currently looking into doing sound or audio engineering jobs, but I also want to try and see If I can go into UX/UI design. I have always loved designing heads up displays and customizing the main menu screens on like streaming services. Here are three Job applications I have found on Linked In that are still hiring.</h2>
