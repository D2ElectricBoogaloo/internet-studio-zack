	<h3>1.	Real Words</h3>
	<p>Repurposed words. Such names can’t be generically descriptive, because then they wouldn’t be protectable trademarks, so they usually work through metaphor or indirect association.
Pros: These names are short and come readymade with rich, often multiple associations.
Cons: Expect to pay money–possibly a lot–to secure the URL. Trademarking can be tricky too.
</p>
	<h3>2. Compund Words</h3>
	<p>Pros: The practically limitless number of possible combinations makes it easy to create a unique name. Interesting meanings can be created through the combination of words.
Cons: No huge drawbacks, which is one reason that compounds are popular, but they are longer than many other kinds of name.
</p>
	<h3>3.	Phrases </h3>
	<p>Pros: Sound linguistically natural and have clear meanings because they follow regular rules.
Cons: Phrase names can be long. Can sound awkward when used as nouns if they are not already noun phrases (e.g. Have you tried iLike?)
