	<h1><strong>ASG08</strong> Chosen Domain Names:</h1>
	<h2>Three Domain Names</h2>
	<p class="byline">October 23 2025 <strong>Zack Merritt</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Real Words</li>
		<li>Compound Words</li>
		<li>Phrases</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I have spoken with one of my classmates Chris about putting together a streaming service idea. The domain pieces that would be suitable are real words, compound words, and phrases. He really liked the compound words because of my unique name that I picked called ScreamStream and has limitless numbers and letters to it. He also liked my phrases domain because of the way it sounds when you want to make your streaming service into a horror focused platform.</p>
	<p>While this can be a lot of fun to use these domains, there might be downsides to making all this happen. The dilemma here is how much it will cost me to purchase these domains because it’s not free to make a secure URL link. I also need to be aware of how long the name should be without filling the whole webpage space.  Lastly, my phrase domain can have long names, and the nouns might sound awkward to put on my streaming service project.</p>
	<h3>1.	Real Words</h3>
	<p>Repurposed words. Such names can’t be generically descriptive, because then they wouldn’t be protectable trademarks, so they usually work through metaphor or indirect association.
Pros: These names are short and come readymade with rich, often multiple associations.
Cons: Expect to pay money–possibly a lot–to secure the URL. Trademarking can be tricky too.
</p>
	<h3>2. Compound Words</h3>
	<p>Pros: The practically limitless number of possible combinations makes it easy to create a unique name. Interesting meanings can be created through the combination of words.
Cons: No huge drawbacks, which is one reason that compounds are popular, but they are longer than many other kinds of name.
</p>
	<h3>3.	Phrases </h3>
	<p>Pros: Sound linguistically natural and have clear meanings because they follow regular rules.
Cons: Phrase names can be long. Can sound awkward when used as nouns if they are not already noun phrases (e.g. Have you tried iLike?)
