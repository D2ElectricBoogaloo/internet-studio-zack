<h1>SONIC FOR PRESIDENT OF MOBIUS</h1>
<img src="images/Sonic.avif">
<h3>Fast. Free. Fearless.</h3>

<h2>Join the Movement</h2>
<p>Sign up to be part of the Fast Future Coalition, help us blast through corruption, and bring Mobius into a new era of freedom and speed!</p>

<h2>WHY SONIC?</h2>
<p>Because the world doesn’t need another slow-talking, robot-building bureaucrat.
Mobius needs action. It needs heart. It needs speed.
“I’m not a politician. I’m just a hedgehog who hates injustice—and loves chili dogs.”
— Sonic the Hedgehog
While Eggman plots domination, and Chaos looms in the shadows, Sonic’s been out there every day: saving zones, freeing animals, and fighting for freedom.
Now, he’s taking the fight to the top.</p>

<h1>THE PLATFORM</h1>

<h3>Freedom for All</h3>

<p>End authoritarian rule and tear down Robotnik’s remaining factories. No Mobian left behind.</p>

<h3>Speed Up Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Why wait 20 years for a monorail when we can build it in 2? Invest in ultra-speed transit powered by Chaos Emeralds.</p>

<h3>Eco-Zone Restoration</h3>

<p>Reclaim polluted zones like Chemical Plant and Oil Ocean. Turn badnik factories into green tech labs.</p>

<h3>Education Reform</h3>

<p>Every Mobian child deserves access to quality education—from Spin Dash 101 to Advanced Emerald Theory.</p>

<h3>Defense Against Evil Geniuses</h3>

<p>No more Eggman attacks. No more G.U.N. experiments. Just peace, stability, and a blue blur who’s always ready to roll.</p>

<h1>MEET THE TEAM</h1>
<ul>Vice President: Miles “Tails” Prower – Engineering genius, and loyal sidekick.</ul>
<ul>Secretary of Rings & Treasury: Knuckles the Echidna – Guardian of the Master Emerald, financial watchdog.</ul>
<ul>Environmental Advisor: Amy Rose – Hammer-wielding protector of nature.</ul>
<ul>Foreign Policy Chief: Shadow the Hedgehog – Because sometimes, you need a wildcard.</ul>

No more waiting around.</P>
