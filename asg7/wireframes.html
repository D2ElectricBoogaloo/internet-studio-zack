<h1>Wireframe Style</h1>
<p>Sketching wireframes by hand offers speed, flexibility, and low-cost making ideas for quickly exploring ideas and encouraging collaboration in early design stages. It allows for rapid iteration without getting bogged down in technical details. However, hand-drawn wireframes can lack precision and consistency, making them harder to share or scale for complex projects. In contrast, wireframe software provides cleaner visuals, easier revisions, and better documentation, but may slow down early creativity due to its structure and learning curve.</p>
<p>I think my wireframe style would be suitable for Low-Fi because I’m putting together a streaming service from scratch. There are so many possibilities that I want to lay out so I would write down my ideas on pen and paper. I can make rapid iterations to one design like how I should customize the homepage. I know the details won’t be pretty, but I would understand how the style should be played out.</p>
