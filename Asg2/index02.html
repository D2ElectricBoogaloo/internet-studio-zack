  <h1>Disscussion</h1>
  <h3>Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic. Of the methods she identifies to banish this troll, which would be most successful for you? Why?</h3>
  <p>The reason why Denise Jacobs argues that we all have a troll-like inner critic who holds us back by spitting self-doubt and negative thoughts at us. Jacob’s methods she identified to banish the troll is naming and externalizing the inner critic.
This method works best because giving the inner critic a name and imagining it as a separate character helps me create distance from the troll’s negativity. Instead of accepting those critical thoughts and negativity, I can recognize them as just noise from “the troll.” This allows me to question and challenge them, rather than let them control me. When I see the inner critic as something outside of myself, it becomes easier to silence it and move forward with confidence.

  <h3>In David McRaney's article, what is "hyperbolic discounting"? List one method McRaney identifies to counteract hyperbolic discounting. Which would work best for you?</h3>
  <p>One method McRaney suggests is setting up automatic systems that remove the need for willpower. Kinda like an automatic savings plans or pre-committing to a goal.
To me, using automatic systems would work best. If I set things up so that money is saved or tasks are scheduled without me having to think about it every time, I’d be much more consistent and less tempted to give in to short-term rewards.

  <h3>Critical Web Design addresses four types of power in networks. As you learn web publishing fundamentals, what network-making power do you (or don't you) have as the creator and publisher of your work?</h3>
  <p>As I learn web publishing fundamentals, I am beginning to understand the network-development power I hold as a creator and publisher. Critical Web Design outlines four types of power in networks: power to constitute the network, power to program the network, power to switch between networks, and power to influence values and norms within networks.
Right now, my power to constitute the network is growing, by creating websites or digital content. I’m able to bring new voices, perspectives, or communities online. I choose what content to publish, which tools to use, and who to link to. This gives me the ability to shape small corners of the web.
However, my power to program the network is still limited. I’m just starting to understand things like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and I don’t yet have the technical or institutional reach to influence major platforms or infrastructures.
Finally, my power to influence values and norms is limited but present. Even as a student, the choices I make about what to share, how to design my site, and which voices to amplify all contribute to shaping online culture in small but meaningful ways.
So, while I don't yet hold all the powers that major platforms or experienced developers might, I do have network-developing power through the act of publishing and designing online content and that power grows as I gain more technical and critical literacy.
