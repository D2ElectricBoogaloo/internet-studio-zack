  <h3>What is the difference between structured content and semantic HTML?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Structured content is the organized arrangement of digital information into data-like components. The relationship between content chunks is explicitly defined and described. Basically, they are already a mainstay of many types of information on the web.</li>
    <li>While semantic HTML is the use of HTML tags. They are markups that communicate information about the meaningful relationships between document elements, as opposed to simply describing how they should look on screen. Semantic HTML uses elements like heading tags and list tags. Just like what we learned from internet studio.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How do they work together?</h3>
  <p>Structured content and semantic HTML play a role together by providing both a conceptual framework and a practical implementation for organizing and conveying meaning in web content.</p>
  <h3>Why is it important to have structured content and semantic HTML in your web pages?</h3>
  <p>The reason to have both structured content and semantic is to make your users able to read your own websites and have a great experience navigating them. They can enhance accessibility, navigate though Search Engine Optimization, and create better user experience.</p>
